    <h1>Spring-Boot-Ready example page</h1>
    <p>This is an example project to play around with spring boot and other nice libraries that can be nicely integrated and turned out as pretty handy to me.</p>
    <p>Furthermore it's a play ground for different possibilities regarding continuous deployment, monitoring and deployment technics.</p>
